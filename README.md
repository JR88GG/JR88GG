#Hi 👋, I'm Heber Antonio Salgado Marín.

##I'm a Systems and Networks Engineering student, currently in my third semester.

##I'm strengthening my programming principles and expanding my knowledge of various technologies.

###📚 I'm currently learning:
   - Bash on Linux and using system tools.

   - Customizing Linux distributions like Arch and Manjaro.

   - Developing web applications using Visual Studio and Entity Framework, with the MVC model and database.

###🚀 Goal: I intend to develop open-source projects for my own learning and, if possible, contribute to others throughout the year.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile.
